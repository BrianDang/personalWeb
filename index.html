          I am currently a student attending the University of Massachusetts
          Amherst studying both Computer Science and Mathematics. I am part
          of the Class of 2020. Before I attended this university,
          I went to Shrewsbury High School where I was first exposed to Java, my first
          programming language. During my time at UMass Amherst, I have learned
          how to write in C++, Python, and front-end languages such as HTML, CSS,
          and Javascript. I am very interested in learning more on machine learning,
          artificial intelligence, and robotics. Outside of my field, I love to hike,
          practice piano, play recretional badminton, and travel to different countries.
          <br><br>
          I am an Undergraduate Course Assistant (UCA) during the school year and
          currently interning for Fidelity Investments in Merrimack, NH.

      <div class="p-2"><span class="subTitle">Technical Intern (Summer 2018):</span> I am currently
         working as a technical intern at Fidelity Investments. While I was at Fidelity,
          I learned the software development cycle and improved my skills in Git.
          My main task was to redesign the user interface of a healthcheck dashboard.
          The healthcheck dashboard would display the healthiness of an application instance.
          An application instance would have two types of healthiness: one being if the
          application sends back a response from the server and the other to test the functionality
          of the application. The website would show all the environments, groups and applications
          and their overall healthiness. We are also planning on implementing a security system to log
          clients in. Our project primarily requires us to learn Angular 6, Maven, Spring, Git, and Java.

      <div class="p-2"><span class="subTitle">Undergraduate Course Assistant (Fall 2017-Now):</span>
        During the school year, I work as an undergraduate course assistant for CMPSCI 187
        (Intro. to Data Structures). Every week, I would help over 200 students
        by answering their questions they post to Piazza and grade their projects, labs
         and exams. The class primarily uses Java to reinforce the concepts of data structures.
        Not only does this reinforces my understanding of basic structures but
         it also give me an opportunity to help students learn.

        In Spring 2018, my friends and I decided to make a boba tea dispenser, our first
         hardware hack. We connected the Amazon Echo Dot to connect to a Raspberry Pi
           through a local server. Afterward, the Raspberry Pi would run a current to a
           small aquarium pump. The pump would then push air into a water bottle and that
           in turn would push the milk tea in the bottle out of the bottle and into a cup.
           My role was to program the Amazon Alexa to connect to the Raspberry Pi. We used
           Python, StdLib API, and Java to build this project.

      <div class="p-2"><span class="subTitle">HackWPI: Wingman (January 2018):</span>
        At HackWPI, my friends and I used a Tinder Bot to cycle through hundreds of Tinder profiles
        and used a machine learning algorithm called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to learn
        all the bios on the profiles cycled through. In the end, we were able to create an
        machine that can output bios similar to the ones it had previously learned.
        We used technologies such as LSTM machine learning algorithm, Python, and Tinder to
        accomplish this task.

        BostonHacks happened on Halloween and my group decided to make an emotion analyzer
        that utilizes Microsoft's Emotion Detector API to analyze people's faces
        in reaction to scary pictures. Originally we wanted to use a webcam or an Android device
        to take pictures of the person's reaction on screen. In the end, however, we managed to
        store pictures online in reaction to pictures and show the details. We used technologies
        such as Microsoft's Emotion API, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Java.

          I am currently a student attending the University of Massachusetts
          Amherst studying both Computer Science and Mathematics. I am part
          of the Class of 2020. Before I attended this university,
          I went to Shrewsbury High School where I was first exposed to Java, my first
          programming language. During my time at UMass Amherst, I have learned
          how to write in C++, Python, and front-end languages such as HTML, CSS,
          and Javascript. I am very interested in learning more on machine learning,
          artificial intelligence, and robotics. Outside of my field, I love to hike,
          practice piano, play recretional badminton, and travel to different countries.
          <br><br>
          I am an Undergraduate Course Assistant (UCA) during the school year and
          currently interning for Fidelity Investments in Merrimack, NH.

      <div class="p-2"><span class="subTitle">Technical Intern (Summer 2018):</span> I am currently
         working as a technical intern at Fidelity Investments. While I was at Fidelity,
          I learned the software development cycle and improved my skills in Git.
          My main task was to redesign the user interface of a healthcheck dashboard.
          The healthcheck dashboard would display the healthiness of an application instance.
          An application instance would have two types of healthiness: one being if the
          application sends back a response from the server and the other to test the functionality
          of the application. The website would show all the environments, groups and applications
          and their overall healthiness. We are also planning on implementing a security system to log
          clients in. Our project primarily requires us to learn Angular 6, Maven, Spring, Git, and Java.

      <div class="p-2"><span class="subTitle">Undergraduate Course Assistant (Fall 2017-Now):</span>
        During the school year, I work as an undergraduate course assistant for CMPSCI 187
        (Intro. to Data Structures). Every week, I would help over 200 students
        by answering their questions they post to Piazza and grade their projects, labs
         and exams. The class primarily uses Java to reinforce the concepts of data structures.
        Not only does this reinforces my understanding of basic structures but
         it also give me an opportunity to help students learn.
